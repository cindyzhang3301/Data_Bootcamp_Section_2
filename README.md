This project was completed by Cindy Zhang and Nadia Shin in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have: Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. And I understand that: Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden. I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
# Abstract
In this project, we analyzed Citi Bike’s data to better understand both the system and the user behaviors. We first mapped out Citi Bike dock distribution, then studied customer behaviors by finding out popular routes and busy hours. From there, we digged deeper into user demographics and analyzed how age, gender, and customer type influence their Citi Bike trips, in terms of departure and destination stations, distance and speed.
